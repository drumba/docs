Trellis offers one-command deploys out of the box with little configuration needed.

## Configuration

Once you've already configured at least one WordPress site and got it working, only one more variable is required:

1. Add the repo (Git URL) of your Bedrock-based WordPress project in the corresponding `group_vars/<environment>/wordpress_sites.yml` file. Make sure its in the SSH format (ex: `git@github.com:roots/bedrock.git`).
2. Optionally set the `branch` you want to deploy for each environment in `wordpress_sites.yml` (defaults to `master`).

## Deploying

* Run `./deploy.sh <environment> <site name>`

`deploy.sh` is a very simply Bash script which just runs the actual `ansible-playbook` command which can be a little annoying to type out.

The actual command looks like this: `ansible-playbook -i hosts/<environment> deploy.yml --extra-vars="site-<site name>"`.

You can always use this command itself since it can take any additional `ansible-playbook` options.

## Hooks

Trellis deploys let you customize what happens at each step of the deploy process. A single deploy has the following steps in order:

1. `initialize` - creates the site directory structure (or ensures it exists)
2. `update` - clones the Git repo onto the remote server
3. `prepare` - prepares the files/directories in the new release path (such as moving the subtree if one exists)
4. `build` - builds the new release by copying templates, files, and folders
5. `share` - symlinks shared files/folders to new release
6. `finalize` - finalizes the deploy by updating the `current` symlink

Each step has a `before` and `after` hook. The hooks are variables that you can define to point to a custom task files. The tasks within that file will be run when the hook fires.

The hook variables available are:

* `deploy_initialize_before`
* `deploy_initialize_after`
* `deploy_update_before`
* `deploy_update_after`
* `deploy_prepare_before`
* `deploy_prepare_after`
* `deploy_build_before`
* `deploy_build_after`
* `deploy_share_before`
* `deploy_share_after`
* `deploy_finalize_before`
* `deploy_finalize_after`

### Default hooks

By default, Trellis only defines and uses two hooks: `deploy_build_after` and `deploy_finalize_after`.

* `deploy_build_after` is used to run `composer install`.
* `deploy_finalize_after` is used to restart services like php5-fpm.

### Custom tasks

To use a hook, define/override the variable in the `deploy.yml` playbook file:

```yml
vars:
  deploy_build_after: "{{ playbook_dir }}/roles/deploy/hooks/build-after.yml"
  deploy_finalize_after: "{{ playbook_dir }}/roles/deploy/hooks/finalize-after.yml"
```

Those are the two default hooks that Trellis already uses. If you want to use the same hooks as we do and override them, we suggest copying the existing file and modifying it.

We also suggest keeping your hooks in a top level `deploy-hooks` folder in your Ansible folder like this:

```yml
vars:
  deploy_build_after: "{{ playbook_dir }}/deploy-hooks/build-after.yml"
  deploy_share_before: "{{ playbook_dir }}/deploy-hooks/share-before.yml"
  deploy_finalize_after: "{{ playbook_dir }}/roles/deploy/hooks/finalize-after.yml"
```

### SSH Keys

Before you can deploy a site to a remote server, your SSH keys need to be working. Trellis takes advantage of SSH forwarding so your remote server does need to generate an SSH key and add it to GitHub/Bitbucket.

The chain works like this: `local machine` -> SSH via Ansible -> `remote server` -> Git clone -> `remote Git repository`

See the [SSH Keys docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/ssh-keys/) on how to get your SSH key added to the `web` user which is the user Trellis deploys with.

### Example

Here's an example of all the configuration needed to deploy a site and what the commands would look like.

Configuration:
```yaml
# group_vars/production/wordpress_sites.yml

wordpress_sites:
  mysite.com:
    site_hosts:
      - mysite.com
    local_path: ../site
    repo: git@github.com:me/mysite.git
    subtree_path: site
    multisite:
      enabled: false
      subdomains: false
    ssl:
      enabled: false
    cache:
      enabled: false
      duration: 30s
    system_cron: true
    env:
      wp_home: http://mysite.com
      wp_siteurl: http://mysite.com/wp
      wp_env: production
      db_name: mysite_prod
      db_user: mysite_dbuser
      db_password: mysite_dbpassword
      auth_key: "{%I[WI!NtN1Oq?Hpc^_zt( 7weXJ9lQtWw!&+jUtTL&54w8$W>C<e=7Eh9cM0 <-)]}"
      secure_auth_key: "[nCt_B.8w4/,LZ<!P5~)gn0iq+2|]I:-D-(de_Aywqrbt2B%js)?=$or/P%5+suc"

      auth_salt: "?*CcWVw9pcuP>i2GUL%]dw_M3S|Pxrt|b)D0ae+3q |CP6T(ES32P1}##a>]PLM@)"
      secure_auth_salt: "(+cTDWkFpkKM}ER!]@pO-%y{NAqw: ]IliLy-(,/a;)^>OB=W|Ne;F)LCAGpgO6{}})"
      logged_in_salt: "vl/7|)]mn9J]+<mqgOlR,NDJzb4b9s/q- FN0`^xo,tRLA:xVln+1<y)1>%=)k#;`"

```

Deploy command:
```
./deploy.sh production mysite.com
```

Or alternatively:
```
ansible-playbook -i hosts/production deploy.yml --extra-vars="site-mysite.com"
```

## Rollbacks

To rollback a deploy, run `ansible-playbook -i hosts/<environment> rollback.yml --extra-vars="site=<site name>"`
