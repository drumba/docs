## Generating production ready assets

Generate production ready assets with `gulp --production`, which will build your assets without the source maps. 

If you use [Trellis](/trellis/), you can copy the `project_pre_build_commands_local` [example](https://github.com/roots/roots-example-project.com/blob/master/ansible/group_vars/production#L3-L9) from the Roots Example Project to build your local assets, then copy them to the remote server during deployment.
